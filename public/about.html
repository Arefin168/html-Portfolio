<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Assalamualaikum, I am MD Arefin Iqram, a dedicated undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at United International University (UIU). 
  My academic journey is driven by a strong passion for embedded systems, robotics, automation, and the practical application of technology to solve real-world challenges</p>

<p>I have hands-on experience developing intelligent hardware systems, including a rescue rover equipped with multiple sensors, robotic components, and remote control capabilities, as well as long-endurance fixed-wing drones designed for surveillance and tactical operations. 
  I actively work with platforms such as ESP32, NodeMCU, and various sensors</p>

<p>In addition to my technical interests, I contribute to the student community as a member of the HR team at the UIU Computer Club, where I engage in organizing events and promoting knowledge-sharing initiatives.</p>

<p>I am continuously seeking opportunities to apply my skills in meaningful projects, research collaborations, and professional environments that value innovation, precision, and impact.</p>
